This is a basic calculator I've made using WPF (C# and XAML) that takes a basic arithmetic expression that the user puts in and churns out the result for you. It includes 4 basic operations, executed in their proper order of precedence and a minimalist interface.

I've taken the basic program from Derek Banas' C# video tutorials and I've decided to complete the program fully and therefore practice. Currently, the core program is completed, but features may be added as I go on with development.
